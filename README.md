# Report your contributions here

## How to report your contribution

Go to the [issues](https://github.com/webvr-india/volunteer-contributions/issues), and put your contributions in the respective open issue. We create three issues every month for following purpose :
* Events conducted in this month - Planning to conduct an event? Put here the name, place and url for the event.
* Projects/Scenes created in this month - Worked on A-Frame and created something? Give us the url of the source & deoployed scene/project location.
* WebVR India in Media this month - Provide the URL of blogpost, tweets, event reports, video or anything related.

## What do we do with this

Every month, we collect your contributions from here and put it on the [Mozilla India WebVR wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/India/WebVR/), which can be later used by A-Frame team to feature your contributions on [A Week Of A-Frame blogposts](http://aframe.io/blog/awoa-25/).
